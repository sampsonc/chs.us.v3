Some context - we are moving.   We've recently enrolled the kids in an out-of-district school.   They are thriving.   So, we decided that we would rent a house in that district and sell our house. In addition to being close to their school and all of those benefits, it aligns well with our plan to eventually buy land and/or build somewhere a little further out of the city.

But, it is very stressful (as moving always is).  17 years of stuff in the same house is a lot!   These posts are to document the crazy.

## Day 0 - 10/3/2021
- Rented a [U-Box](https://www.uhaul.com/UBox/).  This is basically a mini-pod that comes with a trailer.
- Moved most of the outdoor furniture to the rental house.  Primarily because it was empty and we didn't have the key yet, but were hours away from our lease starting.
- Loaded up the [Sactional](https://www.lovesac.com/sactionals.html) in the U-Box in preparation for Day 1.
