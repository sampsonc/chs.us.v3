### What is CORS?
CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resoure sharing and it enables web clients to request content from different origins.   

There are 2 different aspects to CORS - the client side and the server side.  The server-side specifies which type of cross-origin requests are allowed.  The client-side control how the cross-origin requests are made.
