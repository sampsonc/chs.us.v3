# About Carl Sampson
I'm an application security geek currently working for [Proofpoint](https://proofpoint.com). Previously I've worked for [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com), [Teradata](https://www.teradata.com"), [Anthem](https://www.antheminc.com/), and others.

# Things that I'm interested in-
- I started the [OWASP Indianapolis](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-indianapolis/) chapter in 2005 and continue to serve on the leadership team.
- I curate a site called [Appsec.fyi](https://appsec.fyi/).  It contains a collection of links related to application security.   It has since evolved into generally anything technical that I'm interested in, broken down by subject.  I collect the links in [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/@a5bA8g26d79a6T5d4ap7b01p40Tbdf3f98bw6bkb22Yx55A81di6dy80ZxoBq4c1?src=navbar) and the site is automatically updated whenever articles are tagged.
- I like to bike and run.  My current bike is a [Specialized Tarmac](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/shop/bikes/road-bikes/performance-road-bikes/tarmac/c/tarmac).  Follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/6889376").
- I've done a 30k, several half-marathons, and more 5k's than I can remember.
