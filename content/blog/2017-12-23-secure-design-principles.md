Sitting here on a cold, snowy day thinking about secure design principles. These are key to think about during the design phase of a feature/project?

Total Mediation &#8211; every access to every resource must be validated every time

Economy of Mechanism &#8211; keep it as simple as possible

Fail-Safe &#8211; in case of failure, default to a secure state

Defense in Depth &#8211; layer security

Open Design &#8211; the security of a system should not be dependent on secrecy of its design or implementation

Psychological Acceptability &#8211; security mechanisms must not make resources more difficult to access then if they weren&#8217;t there

Least Privilege &#8211; limit access to a system/feature to only those that \*need\* to access it for the shortest duration possible

Minimize attack surface &#8211; reduce risk by reducing the attack surface area

Secure Defaults &#8211; default to a secure state

Any others you can think of?

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					data-ulike-id="126"
					data-ulike-nonce="988d56c687"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_126"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
</div>
