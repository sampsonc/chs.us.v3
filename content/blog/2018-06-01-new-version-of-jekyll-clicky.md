I&#8217;ve updated jekyll-clicky to version 0.1.3. This fixes an issue where some posts weren&#8217;t getting the javascript code and changed it to be asynchronous..

Check it out at [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-clicky) and find the source at [Github](https://github.com/sampsonc/jekyll-clicky).
